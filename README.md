# Teams UI Kit for developers

The [Teams UI kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/design/design-teams-app-ui-templates) is great, but I'm by far a designer, so I never worked with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and wasn't planning on doing so.

In my search for the CSS files, I can up empty, bummer.

## Resources

The toolkit wants you to have some resources at hand prior to using the Toolkit.

### Segoe UI Font

This font is provided as TTF font, but most browsers want a woff font. To have a consistent look across all devices, you cannot count on the device having the correct font.

We used [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) to generate the correct files, but I'm not sure on the license of the result.
