The [Teams UI kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/design/design-teams-app-ui-templates) is great, but I'm by far a designer, so I never worked with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and wasn't planning on doing so.

In my search for the CSS files, I can up empty, bummer.

## Insprired by not copied

I already told you, I'm no designer. As a developer I tried to replicate common Teams UI Kit components. Please be kind to each other, instead of telling they are wrong or don't work for you [send a PR](https://github.com/svrooij/teams-ui-for-developers/compare).
