The [Teams UI kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/design/design-teams-app-ui-templates) is great, but I'm by far a designer, so I never worked with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and wasn't planning on doing so.

In my search for the CSS files, I can up empty, bummer.
